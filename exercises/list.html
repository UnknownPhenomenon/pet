      <h2>Trivia</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Hua Cheng's nickname, <em>San Lang</em>, means "third son".
          <ul>
            <li>
              In-world, he is called this as he was supposedly the third son of
              his family, although there is no confirmation whether he made this
              up or he actually had siblings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meta-wise, San Lang is the continuation of an in-joke where all
              the main love interests of Mo Xiang Tong Xiu's novels have
              monikers that can be organized chronologically -
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Luo Bingge</strong> (Big brother Luo) from Scum
                  Villain Self-Saving System
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lan Er-ge</strong> (Second brother Lan) from
                  Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>San Lang</strong> (Third son) from Heaven Official's
                  Blessing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The main character of MXTX's fourth novel also follows this
                  trend, the character having the nickname
                  <strong>Si Shao</strong> (Fourth young master).
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          His most famous moniker, Crimson Rain Sought Flower, was attained
          during his early days as a supreme. After he annihilated a ghost's
          lair and causing blood rain to fall, he found a lone, white flower
          struggling under the heavy rainfall, so he shielded it with his
          umbrella.
          <ul>
            <li>
              In a meta sense, "Crimson Rain Sought Flower" (血雨探花) is also a
              reference; tanhua (探花, lit. flower snatcher) is the title of the
              overall third-place scorer of the ancient Chinese imperial
              examinations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Xuěyǔ (血雨) can also mean "heavy rain colored by loess sandstorm"
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Hua Cheng has incredibly bad handwriting, but Xie Lian often helps him
          practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even though he is canonically one of the most handsome men in the
          novel, he sees himself as being ugly and deformed. MXTX confirmed
          this, saying that because in childhood he was often called an ugly
          beast due to his heterochromia. As he grew in power he began to
          believe that he's not bad-looking but would still feel lacking in
          front of Xie Lian. <sup>[8]</sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          MXTX confirmed in an interview that out of the three main love
          interests in her novels, Hua Cheng has the best skills in bed.
          <sup>[9]</sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          Some said that Hua Cheng is the only one who can curse and insult the
          Heavenly Emperor without fearing any retribution due to his power.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the novel's postscript, Hua Cheng is confirmed to have a father of
          Xianle royal capital while his mother was described as being 'an evil
          beauty of foreign ethnicity'. Due to this, Hua Cheng had traces of a
          foreign culture, such as his connection with butterflies, maple
          leaves, silver accessory and beast totems. <sup>[10]</sup>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The butterflies, maple leaves, silver accessory and beast totems
              are common symbols in the Miao/Hmong people's culture.
            </li>
            <li>
              In an abandoned draft, Hua Cheng often sang a love song in a
              long-lost language his mother taught him for his beloved. Whenever
              Xie Lian asked what he's singing, he would have answered with
              nonsense.
            </li>
            <li>
              As MXTX wrote the novel she felt that Hua Cheng's parentage and
              background wasn't necessary, so she scrapped it all.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Hua Cheng's "birthplace" is Shanghai as MXTX was struck by inspiration
          to make his character when travelling there. <sup>[10]</sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          He is so unbearably rich that he would treat legendary, incomparably
          precious treasures like they're disposable garbage. <sup>[7]</sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          In the manhua Hua Cheng’s symbolic animal is a fox as seen in both art
          by the official artist and actual chapters. In addition, Mu Qing
          explains, “Hua Cheng will only need to humor him with a couple of
          sweet words, and he’ll believe him, just like one enchanted by a fox
          spirit.” <sup>[11]</sup>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In Asian folktales fox spirits are seductresses, known to enchant
              and charm innocent people and make them fall helplessly in love
              with the spirit.
